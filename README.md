# [Skill Nexus](https://skill.hacknexus.io)

## The Hack Nexus tool for learning and practicing Shell commands.

This site is a WIP and will be rolled out as I continue developing it. If you'd like to contribute, you can do so by opening a Pull Request or join the [Hack Nexus Discord](https://discord.gg/6tSbqvn7K6) and contact me there.

## Development Scripts and Other Information

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Contributing by adding new tests

If you'd like to add new practice tests, you can do so by looking at the [commands.json](https://github.com/Doc0x1/skillnexus/blob/master/src/commands.json) file and adding other tests to it.

## Future planned practice tests for the site

In the future I have plans to include practice tests for PowerShell, Command Prompt and Zsh.
